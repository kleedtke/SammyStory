In a galaxy far, far away lived an alien named Joe.
He loved to eat poptarts and scrapbook.

One day while cruising through the universe, Joe found himself
surrounded my mean alien pirates looking to steal all of his 
space credits. Oh, what will our hero do now?

Joe was super anxious about all the pirates surrounding him, so 
he decided to call a meeting with his best men. He needed to make
sure there were poptarts there though. Would those calm them??
